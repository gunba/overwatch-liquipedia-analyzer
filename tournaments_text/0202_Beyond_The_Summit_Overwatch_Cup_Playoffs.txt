==Format==
*All games will be played using the “Competitive” ruleset with no sudden death.
*Heroes will be restricted to one of each per team.
*Stopwatch will determine the result of successful escorts/assaults on mirrored maps. The Competitive distance tracker will determine the result of failed escorts on mirrored maps.
*For assault (and hybrid before payload unlocks), the winner will be determined first by points unlocked, then by point ticks. If teams end on the same tick, a {{Abbr/Bo1}} KotH map will be used to determine the result.
*Control maps will be {{Abbr/Bo5}}.
*The cups will feature a double elimination bracket with Bo3 map mirrors until the finals (WB and LB final will be Bo5). The top two teams from the first two cups will advance to a third 4-team cup to compete for the $10,000 prize pool.
